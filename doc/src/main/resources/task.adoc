## Task definition

### Problem Statement

We have a group of sales people who have many email conversations going on at the same time with their customers.
Sometimes these threads are started and then forgotten because the customer fails to reply, so we would like to improve the response rates of customers to these emails.
Therefore, we would like a service which sends follow-up emails when a customer has not responded to an email from our sales people.

### Solution

We would like you to create the service which sends these follow-up emails.
It should:
* See when our sales person has sent an email
* Check whether the customer has responded to that email, and then decide whether to send a follow-up email and when to send it
* Once the customer has responded, stop sending follow-up emails
* Operational parameters of the service should be configurable

### What to Send Us

* A link to a Git repo containing the code for a small Java service **that can be easily started** with specified email inbox credentials.
The service can use [IMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol) protocol to connect to the mailbox.
* Instructions for building and running the service
* Any thoughts that you have about making a service like this production-ready

### Hints

You can register a Gmail account and follow [this](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?hl=en) to connect with IMAP. Using Gmail is not a requirement, but it is a quick and easy way to get a mailbox with IMAP support.
